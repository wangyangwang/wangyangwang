Hi this is Yang, aka 黄瓜, an interdisciplinary artist, researcher and software engineer. I explore computing’s sociocultural dimensions through critical works, writing, and pedagogy, leveraging critical technical practice and speculative inquiry to challenge hegemonic technological constructs. My background in computer engineering and media arts shapes my creative practice as I study modern computing's cultural, political, ecological imprints. I envision alternative, more communal and ethical technical futures through software prototypes, writings, and initiatives. I have taught courses on simulation and media arts at institutions including The Cooper Union and Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts. Previously affiliated with art & tech incubators _Eyebeam_, _Pioneer Works_ and _NEW INC_ at the _New Museum_, I am currently focused on independent research and creation aimed at sparking discourse on technology’s complex societal influences.
